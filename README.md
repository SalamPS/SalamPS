# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Salam!

Ever since I wrote my first line of code, I've been deeply passionate about web development. My journey has been driven by a love for the MERN Stack, which has led me to become proficient in Next.js for web applications and React Native for mobile applications.

My enthusiasm for technology doesnâ€™t stop there. As I delved deeper into the world of development, I became increasingly fascinated by the idea of bridging the gap between the digital and physical worlds. This curiosity led me to explore Python Machine Learning and IoT. I'm striving to bring the best of AI to human life by combining real-world machines with the power of the internet.
